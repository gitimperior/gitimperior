- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @gitimperior very passionate about technology especially in creating websites.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in learning about websites and games.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m learning through youtube, www3 and other free helps in making website.
- Now I enrolled at Code Institue by London South Bank University.
- I actively seek technology problems and think of a working solution to them, like when Sony PSP can access the internet for the first time and inputting website's address with the device was so cumbersome, I developed a "just-a-click" solution using a free tool to input your favourite website and view it on the PSP screen. This was before the touch screen and voice command era. I am seeking collaboration to other problem solvers out there as I have an idea that can be used in the future.
